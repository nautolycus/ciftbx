 Compiled binaries for some architectures (ix86 Linux, Sun Sparc, SGI) are available

   CIFtbx is a tool box of Fortran routines for manipulating CIF data. CYCLOPS2,
   cif2cif, cif2xml and cif2pdb are open source Fortran programs based on CIFtbx.
   CYCLOPS2 checks STAR data names against data name dictionaries. cif2cif copies a
   CIF to a CIF while checking data names against dictionaries and reformating
   numbers with esd's to conform to the rule of 19. A request list may be
   specified. cif2xml is a variant of cif2cif which produces XML output. cif2pdb
   converts mmCIF files to a PDB or WPDB format.

   In order to ensure continuing availability of source code and documentation most
   programs and documents on this site are subject to copyright. This does not
   prevent you from using the programs, from making copies and changes, but
   prevents the creation of "closed source" versions out of the open source
   versions. See NOTICE.

   Science is best served when the tools we use are fully understood by those who
   wield those tools and by those who make used of results obtained with those
   tools. When a scientific tool exists as software, access to source code is an
   important element in achieving full understanding of that tool. As our field
   evolves and new versions of software are required, access to source allows us to
   adapt our tools quickly and effectively.

   In the early days of software development, most scientific software source code
   was freely and openly shared with a minimum of formalities. These days, it
   appears that carefully drawn legal documents are necessary to protect free
   access to the source code of scientific software. We are all deeply indebted to
   Richard Stallman for showing us how a creative combination of copyrights and
   seemingly restrictive licenses could give us truly unfettered freedom to use
   programs, to read their source code and to develop new versions. The GNU
   project, and the Linux project have shown that an open source approach works. We
   use the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") for our programs starting with
   the release of CIFtbx3. Older versions use the license from OpenRasmol. The
   OpenRasMol conditions for use have correctly been called "GPL-like".

   If you are a user of these programs, you will find that the copyrights and
   notices ask little more of you than that you avoid mistakes by others by keeping
   the notices with copies, display scientific integrity by citing your sources
   properly and treating this like other shared scientific developments by not
   inferring a warranty. If you are a software developer and wish to incorporate
   what you find here into new code, or to pick up bits and pieces and use them in
   another context, the situation becomes more complex. Read the notices carefully.
   You will find that they are "infectious". Whatever you make from our Open Source
   code must itself be offered as Open Source code. In addition, in order to allow
   users to understand what has changed and to ensure orderly development you have
   to describe your changes.

   CIFtbx Primer Plus (320K in PDF format) provides documentation on CIFtbx.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In order to get a complete release of CIFtbx4, CYCLOPS2, cif2cif, cif2xml you
   will need either a C-shell archive or a shell archive of each package. That is,
   you need either

   ciftbx.cshar.Z, cyclops.cshar.Z, cif2cif.cshar.Z, cif2xml.cshar.Z and
   cif2pdb.cshar.Z or

   ciftbx.shar.Z, cyclops.shar.Z, cif2cif.shar.Z, cif2xml.shar.Z and cif2pdb.shar.Z

   You do not need both sets. If you cannot decompress files at your end, then you
   may wish to have ciftbx.cshar, cyclops.cshar, cif2cif.cshar, cif2xml.cshar and
   cif2pdb.cshar

   In order to test the programs, you will need at least the following CIF
   dictionaries: cif_core.dic.Z cif_mm.dic.Z and cif_mm_pdbx.dic.Z Check the IUCr
   web page at http://www.iucr.org for latest versions.

   The directory structure within which you will work is

 
                                  top level directory
                                  -------------------
                                          |
                                          |
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      |              |             |              |              |             |
 dictionaries   ciftbx.src     cyclops.src   cif2cif.src   cif2xml.src   cif2pdb.src
 ------------   ----------     -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------

   In order to save space and transmission time, it is possible that each archive
   will be compressed before you pick it up. Place the archives in the top level
   directory and the dictionaries into the 'dictionaries' directory. Be sure to
   uncompress the archives before trying to unpack them. If you are on a UNIX
   system, leave the dictionaries compressed.

   Each archive contains a detailed README file for the package involved. Please do
   read the README. The general approach is:

   1. unpack the archive

   2. make all

   3. make tests

   Since all this code depends on CIFtbx, you must install CIFtbx before installing
   CYCLOPS2, cif2cif, cif2xml or cif2pdb. If you don't need CYCLOPS2 or cif2cif or
   cif2xml or cif2pdb, you may leave them out, but they are good examples of
   working CIFtbx applications, so we suggest taking a look at them if you are new
   to CIFtbx.
