     __________________________________________________________________

   CIFtbx is a tool box of Fortran routines for manipulating CIF data.
   CYCLOPS2, cif2cif, cif2xml and cif2pdb are open source Fortran programs
   based on CIFtbx. CYCLOPS2 checks STAR data names against data name
   dictionaries. cif2cif copies a CIF to a CIF while checking data names
   against dictionaries and reformating numbers with esd's to conform to
   the rule of 19. A request list may be specified. cif2xml is a variant
   of cif2cif which produces XML output. cif2pdb converts mmCIF files to a
   PDB or WPDB format.

   In order to ensure continuing availability of source code and
   documentation most programs and documents on this site are subject to
   copyright. This does not prevent you from using the programs, from
   making copies and changes, but prevents the creation of "closed source"
   versions out of the open source versions. See [12]NOTICE.

   Science is best served when the tools we use are fully understood by
   those who wield those tools and by those who make used of results
   obtained with those tools. When a scientific tool exists as software,
   access to source code is an important element in achieving full
   understanding of that tool. As our field evolves and new versions of
   software are required, access to source allows us to adapt our tools
   quickly and effectively.

   In the early days of software development, most scientific software
   source code was freely and openly shared with a minimum of formalities.
   These days, it appears that carefully drawn legal documents are
   necessary to protect free access to the source code of scientific
   software. We are all deeply indebted to [13]Richard Stallman for
   showing us how a creative combination of copyrights and seemingly
   restrictive licenses could give us truly unfettered freedom to use
   programs, to read their source code and to develop new versions. The
   [14]GNU project, and the [15]Linux project have shown that an open
   source approach works. We use the GNU General Public License (the
   [16]"GPL") for our programs starting with the release of CIFtbx3. Older
   versions use the license from [17]OpenRasmol. The OpenRasMol conditions
   for use have correctly been called "GPL-like".

   If you are a user of these programs, you will find that the copyrights
   and notices ask little more of you than that you avoid mistakes by
   others by keeping the notices with copies, display scientific integrity
   by citing your sources properly and treating this like other shared
   scientific developments by not inferring a warranty. If you are a
   software developer and wish to incorporate what you find here into new
   code, or to pick up bits and pieces and use them in another context,
   the situation becomes more complex. Read the notices carefully. You
   will find that they are "infectious". Whatever you make from our Open
   Source code must itself be offered as Open Source code. In addition, in
   order to allow users to understand what has changed and to ensure
   orderly development you have to describe your changes.

   [18]CIFtbx Primer Plus (320K in PDF format) provides documentation on
   CIFtbx.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In order to get a complete release of CIFtbx4, CYCLOPS2, cif2cif,
   cif2xml you will need either a C-shell archive or a shell archive of
   each package. That is, you need either

   [19]ciftbx.cshar.Z, [20]cyclops.cshar.Z, [21]cif2cif.cshar.Z,
   [22]cif2xml.cshar.Z and [23]cif2pdb.cshar.Z or

   [24]ciftbx.shar.Z, [25]cyclops.shar.Z, [26]cif2cif.shar.Z,
   [27]cif2xml.shar.Z and [28]cif2pdb.shar.Z

   You do not need both sets. If you cannot decompress files at your end,
   then you may wish to have [29]ciftbx.cshar, [30]cyclops.cshar,
   [31]cif2cif.cshar, [32]cif2xml.cshar and [33]cif2pdb.cshar

   In order to test the programs, you will need at least the following CIF
   dictionaries: [34]cif_core.dic.Z [35]cif_mm.dic.Z and
   [36]cif_mm_pdbx.dic.Z Check the IUCr web page at
   [37]http://www.iucr.org for latest versions.

   The directory structure within which you will work is

                                 top level directory
                                 -------------------
                                         |
                                         |
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     |              |             |              |              |             |
[38]dictionaries   [39]ciftbx.src     [40]cyclops.src   [41]cif2cif.src   [42]ci
f2xml.src   [43]cif2pdb.src
------------   ----------     -----------   -----------   -----------   --------
---

   In order to save space and transmission time, it is possible that each
   archive will be compressed before you pick it up. Place the archives in
   the top level directory and the dictionaries into the 'dictionaries'
   directory. Be sure to uncompress the archives before trying to unpack
   them. If you are on a UNIX system, leave the dictionaries compressed.

   Each archive contains a detailed README file for the package involved.
   Please do read the README. The general approach is:

   1. unpack the archive

   2. make all

   3. make tests

   Since all this code depends on CIFtbx, you must install CIFtbx before
   installing CYCLOPS2, cif2cif, cif2xml or cif2pdb. If you don't need
   CYCLOPS2 or cif2cif or cif2xml or cif2pdb, you may leave them out, but
   they are good examples of working CIFtbx applications, so we suggest
   taking a look at them if you are new to CIFtbx.
