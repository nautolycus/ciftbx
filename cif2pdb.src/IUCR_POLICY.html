<h1> 
             The IUCr Policy for the Protection and the Promotion
                     of the STAR File and CIF Standards
               for Exchanging and Archiving Electronic Data.
</h1>
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
  The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for information
  interchange promulgated by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr).
  CIF (Hall, Allen &amp; Brown, 1991) is the recommended method for submitting
  publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal
  structure determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica and many
  other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the more general STAR
  File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches are used increasingly in
  the structural sciences for data exchange and archiving, and are having a
  significant influence on these activities in other fields.
 
 
  <h3>Statement of intent</h3>
 
  The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data interchange
  standard for science, and its interest in the CIF, a conformant derivative
  of the STAR File, is as a concise data exchange and archival standard
  for crystallography and structural science.
 
 
  <h3>Protection of the standards</h3>
 
  To protect the STAR File and the CIF as standards for interchanging and
  archiving electronic data, the IUCr, on behalf of the scientific community,
 <ul>
        <li> holds the copyrights on the standards themselves,
 
        <li> owns the associated trademarks and service marks, and
 
        <li> holds a patent on the STAR File.
 </ul>
 
  These intellectual property rights relate solely to the interchange
  formats, not to the data contained therein, nor to the software used
  in the generation, access or manipulation of the data.
 
 
  <h3>Promotion of the standards</h3>
 
  The sole requirement that the IUCr, in its protective role, imposes on
  software purporting to process STAR File or CIF data is that the following
  conditions be met prior to sale or distribution.
 
 <ul>
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>read</b> files written to either the STAR File or the
     CIF standard must be able to extract the pertinent data from a file
     conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.
 
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>write</b> files in either the STAR File, or the CIF,
     standard must produce files that are conformant to the STAR File syntax,
     or the CIF syntax, respectively.
 
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>read</b> definitions from a specific data dictionary
     <b>approved by the IUCr</b> must be able to extract any pertinent definition
     which is conformant to the dictionary definition language (DDL)[3]
     associated with that dictionary.
 </ul>
  The IUCr, through its Committee on CIF Standards, will assist any developer
  to verify that software meets these conformance conditions.

            The IUCr Policy on the Use of  the  
          Crystallographic  Information File (CIF) </h1>
<p>
The Crystallographic Information File (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991)
is,  as  of  January  1992, the recommended method for submitting
publications to <i>Acta Crystallographica</i> Section  C.  The  International
Union  of Crystallography holds the Copyright on the CIF,
and has applied for  Patents on the STAR File syntax which is the
basis for the CIF format.
<p>
It is a principal objective of the IUCr to promote the use of CIF
for the exchange and storage of scientific data. The IUCr's sponsorship
of the CIF development was motivated by its responsibility  to 
its scientific journals, which set the standards in crystallographic
publishing.  The  IUCr  intends  that CIFs will be used increasingly
for electronic submission of manuscripts to these journals in
future. The IUCr  recognises  that,  if  the  CIF and the STAR
File are to be adopted as a means for universal data  exchange, 
the  syntax  of these files must be strictly and uniformly adhered to.
Even small deviations from the syntax would ultimately cause the 
demise  of the universal file concept. Through its Copyrights and
Patents the IUCr has taken the steps needed to ensure strict
conformance with this syntax.
<p>
The IUCr policy on the use of the CIF and STAR File processes  is
as follows:
<hr><p>
<ul>
   <li>1 <b>CIFs and STAR Files may be generated, stored or transmitted,
     without permission or charge,</b> provided their  purpose is not
     specifically  for profit  or commercial gain,  and  provided
     that the published syntax is strictly adhered to.
    <p> 
   <li>2 <b>Computer software may be developed for use with CIFs or STAR
     files, without permission or charge,</b> provided it is
     distributed in the public domain. This condition also applies to
     software  for  which a charge is made,  provided  that  its
     primary  function  is  for  use  with  files  that  satisfy
     condition 1 and that it is distributed as a minor component
     of a larger package of software.
    <p> 
   <li>3 <b>Permission will be granted</b> for the use of CIFs and STAR
     Files for specific  commercial  purposes (such as databases
     or network exchange processes),  and for  the  distribution 
     of commercial CIF/STAR  software, on written application to
     the  IUCr Executive  Secretary,  2  Abbey  Square,  Chester
     CH1 2HU, England.  The nature, terms and  duration of the licences
     granted  will  be  determined  by the  IUCr  Executive  and
     Finance Committees.
</ul>
<hr><p>
In summary, the IUCr wishes to promote the use of the  STAR  File
concepts  as  a  standard  universal data file. It will insist on
strict compliance with the published syntax for all applications.
To  assist  with this compliance, the IUCr provides public domain
software for checking the logical integrity of  a  CIF,  and  for
validating the data name definitions contained within a CIF. 
Detailed information on this  software,  and  the  associated 
dictionaries,  may  be  obtained  from  the  IUCr  Office at 5 Abbey
Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England. -->
