   This program is available as a compressed shar cif2pdb.shar.Z (3
   megabytes), a compressed C-shell shar cif2pdb.cshar.Z (3 megabytes) or as
   individual files, as given in the MANIFEST.

   If your system cannot handle a Unix-style compressed file, you may wish to
   download an uncompressed shar cif2pdb.shar or an uncompressed cshar
   cif2pdb.cshar.

   This program is version 2.0.3 of cif2pdb, capable of doing a conversion of
   an mmCIF data set to a partial pseudo-PDB entry with HEADER, TITLE,
   COMPND, SOURCE, KEYWRD, AUTHOR, JRNL, REMARK 1, REMARK 960, SEQRES,
   CRYST1, ORIGX, SCALE, ATOM, SIGATM, ANISOU, SIGUIJ (starting with U's or
   B's), HETATM, MASTER and END records. Fractional or orthogonal coordinates
   may be provided in the mmCIF data set. If an mmCIF dictionary or other
   dictionary with the necessary aliases between mmCIF and the core is
   provided, the program can convert core CIF data sets. This is sufficient
   to drive RASMOL. With version 2, the alternative of using WPDB for output
   is provided, flagged by use of the -w option on the command line and in
   the output by the LEADER record in place of a HEADER record.

   Comments to yaya@bernstein-plus-sons.com appreciated.

WARNING

   ***** This directory contain files with the suffix ".pdb" Those files were
   produced by cif2pdb and are _not_ PDB entries.

SYNOPSIS

 cif2pdb [-i input_cif] [-o output_entry] [-d dictionary]
          [-p pdb_entry_id] [-f command_file] [-t u|l|p]
          [-w yes|no] [-m string_in_cif string_in_pdb]
          [[[input_cif] [[output_entry] [dictionary]]]
  input_cif defaults to $CIF2PDB_INPUT_CIF or stdin
  output_cif defaults to $CIF2PDB_OUTPUT_ENTRY or stdout
  dictionary defaults to $CIF2PDB_CHECK_DICTIONARY
  multiple dictionaries may be specified
  input_cif of "-" is stdin, output_entry of "-" is stdout
  -t has values of u for upper case, l for upper/lower,
     p for PDB typesetting codes, (default -t l)
  -w has the values yes or no (default -w no)

COMPILATION

   There are strong assumptions in the build of cif2pdb about the directory
   structure. cif2pdb is a ciftbx application. It is assumed that cif2pdb.src
   is inserted in the ciftbx directory tree at the same level as ciftbx.src
   In order to avoid clobbering a prior version before you know this release
   of cif2pdb is working correctly in your system, you should save a copy of
   the current cif2pdb.src directory before unpacking this package.

   The resulting directory structure should be

                    top level directory
                    -------------------
                            |
            ----------------------------------
            |               |                 |
         cif2pdb.src    ciftbx.src      dictionaries
         -----------    ----------      ------------

   In order to compile you will need a copy of ciftbx. In order to recreate
   the test output you will need a copy of the an appropriate mmCIF
   dictionary. Compilation is controlled by Makefile, which may need changes
   for the target system. Changes can be made by editing Makefile, if
   necessary, but in most cases it is easier to edit the m4 document,
   Makefile.m4, and then

   make Makefile_local

   which will replace the current Makefile. Then cif2pdb can be compiled and
   tested by

   make cif2pdb
   make tests

CHANGES

   Release 2.0.3 adpated cif2pdb to the changes in CIFtbx for release CIFtbx
   4.1.0

   Release 2.0.2 incorporated improvements to the Makefile by G. Todorov to
   add a "make disclean" clause, correct an error in the definition of
   MMDICPATH, and add the entry for cif_mm_pdb2cif.dic to the dictionaries
   directory. The "make tests" clause was updated to include a timer. In
   order to improve timing, a counted string version of splitstr called
   csplitstr was created. instead of

   Release 2.0.1 added support for WPDB , corrected errors in the creation of
   REMARK 960 (and changed REMARK 960 to REMARK 9600 for the wide ), added
   the code for TITLE, SEQRES, FTNOTE and to handle anisotropic temperature
   factors from a separate loop. The changes for WPDB include increases in
   the line length for the input CIFS to 2048 characters.

   Release 1.0.2 corrected a error in the forming REF fields that caused some
   field to be truncated. Our thanks to Vince Stanev for isolating the
   problem. The duplicate upcase function was removed, since it is now in
   ciftbx.

   Release 1.0.1 corrected the spelling of _atom_sites.fract_transf_matrix...
   and improved the handling of category keys.
