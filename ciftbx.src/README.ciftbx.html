<P>
 This is a version of CIFtbx which has been extended to work with CIF2, DDlm
 DDL 2 and mmCIF as well as with DDL 1.4 and core CIF dictionaries.  CIFtbx
 version 1 was written by Sydney R. Hall (see Hall, S. R., 
 &quot;CIF Applications
 IV.  CIFtbx: a Tool Box for Manipulating CIFs&quot;, J. Appl. Cryst 
(1993). 26,
 482-494.  The revisions for version 2 were done by Herbert J. Bernstein
 and Sydney R. Hall (see Hall, S. R. and Bernstein, H. J., 
 &quot;CIFtbx 2:
 Extended Tool Box for Manipulating CIFs,&quot; J. Appl. Cryst. (1996). 29, 
 598-603.) 
 The revisions for versions 3 and 4 were done by Herbert J. Bernstein, work
 funded in part by the Internationa Union of Crystallography
<hr>
<P>
    This file contains the complete set of source decks and test data
    needed to implement and test the CIFtbx Tool Box routines, Version
    4.1.1
<P>
    This is a release of version 4 of the CIF Tool Box with the
    necessary revisions to handle bracketed the bracketed constructs
    used in DDLm, building on the release 3 changes to handle the long 
    lines of the CIF 1.1 standard and use either DDL 1.4 or DDL 2.1.0 
    Dictionaries.  The change from version 4.1.0 to 4.1.1 is the addition
    of support for html output from cif2cif to improve automation of 
    the release of an updated CBF dictionary.

    It has been tried against cif_core.dic (version 2.0.1) 
    and cif_mm.dic (version of 1.0.0).  As of this writing, CIF 2 is still
    being defined and is subject to change.  As CIF 2 and DDLm change,
    further releases of CIFtbx in this series will be made.  Use this
    release with caution.

<PRE>
    *** ========================================================== ***
    *** ========================================================== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; The release kit has been reorganized.  The kits&lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; for CYCLOPS2 and cif2cif are now distributed   &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; separately from ciftbx.  As of version 2.5.4   &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; compressed versions of dictionaries are used   &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***

</PRE>
<P>
    We have tested this code.  We believe this version is
    reasonably stable and ready for use.  However, as with any major
    revision to a subroutine library, there will be some problems and
    bugs we have not found.  Please report any difficulties with this
    version to either of the second author.
<P>
    See the section CHANGES, below, for a summary of the differences
    between this version and earlier CIFtbx 2 and 3 versions as well 
    as between CIFtbx 2 and the CIFtbx 1 version of 6 July 1995.



<H3>
    1.  INSTALLATION
</H3>
<P>
    Here is the recommended procedure for implementing and testing this
    version of ciftbx.
<P>
    1.0.  Before you try to install this version of CIFtbx
<PRE>   
    *** ========================================================== ***
    *** ========================================================== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; To test CIFtbx, you must have the dictionaries &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; cif_core.dic.Z, cif_mm.dic.Z,                  &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; cif_expanded_jun06.dic.Z in compressed         &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; form installed in a directory named            &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; dictionaries.                                  &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
    *** ========================================================== ***
    *** ========================================================== ***
</PRE>
<P>    
        The directory structure within which you will work is
<PRE> 
                      top level directory
                      -------------------
                               |
                               |
                       ----------------
                       |              |
                  dictionaries   ciftbx.src
                  ------------   ----------
</PRE>    
                
<P>
       You may have acquired this package in one of several forms.
       The most likely are as a &quot;C-shell Archive,&quot; a &quot;Shell Archive&quot;,
       or as separate files.  The idea is to get to separate files,
       all in the same directory, but let's start with the possibility
       that you got the package as one big file, i.e. in one of
       the archive file formats.  Place the archive in the top level
       directory.  If you picked it up in compressed format, be certain
       to uncompress it.
<PRE>
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; The files in this kit will unpack into a       &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; directory named ciftbx.src.  It is a good idea &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; to save the current contents of ciftbx.src     &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; and then to make the directory empty           &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
</PRE>
<P>
       If you are on a machine which does not provide a unix-like shell,
       you will need to take apart the archive by hand using a text
       editor.  We'll get to that in a moment.

<P>
       1.1.  ON A UNIX MACHINE
<P>
       If you have the shell archive on a unix machine, follow the
       instructions at the front of the archive, i.e. save the
       uncompressed archive file as &quot;file&quot;, then, if the archive 
       is a &quot;Shell Archive&quot; execute &quot;sh file&quot;.  If the archive is 
       a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot; execute &quot;csh file&quot;.
<P>
       1.2. IF YOU DON'T HAVE UNIX
<P>
       If sh or csh are not available, then it is best to start with the
       &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot; and do the steps that follow.  If you must
       use the &quot;Shell Archive&quot; you should be aware that the lines
       you want to extract have been prefixed with &quot;X&quot;, while most of
       the lines you want to discard have not.  For a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot;
       such prefixes are rare and the file is easier to read.  Assume
       you have a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot;.
<P>
       Use your editor to separate the different parts of the file into
       individual files in your workspace. Each part starts with
       a lot of unixisms, then several blank lines and then two lines
       which identify the file, and most importantly, contain the
       text &quot;CUT_HERE_CUT_HERE_CUT_HERE&quot;  You can look at the line
       before and the line after to see if you are at the head or
       tail of a file.  Use your editor to search for the &quot;CUT_HERE&quot;
       lines. Each part is carefully labeled and indicates the  
       recommended filename for the separated file. On some machines
       these filenames may need to be altered to suit the OS or compiler.
       (e.g. on MS/DOS PC's you may want to change 'hash_funcs.f' to
       something like 'hashfunc.for').  Even though this particular release
       has no lines for which an &quot;X&quot; prefix is used within a file, be
       warned that, in general, you should look for lines that start
       with &quot;X&quot; and remove the &quot;X&quot;.

</PRE>
<H3>
    2. MAKING LISTINGS
</H3>
       Once you have separated out these files, list 'ciftbx.f', 'Makefile',
       'hash_funcs.f', 'tbx_exm.f', 'tbx_ex.f' and tbx_ex3.f in particular
       (all if possible!) and carefully read the descriptions in the front
       of these files. Remember that 'tbx_ex.f' and 'tbx_exm.f' are only
       examples of CIF applications -- they show how some basic CIF 
       operations can be performed, but they are not necessarily sensible
       or typical of what an actual application would look like!
<P>
       WARNING -- if you are running on a SUN, or other system which
       treats floating point underflows as an error, you may wish to
       list 'clearfp_sun.f'


<H3>
    3. COMPILING AND EXECUTING
</H3>
       You are now ready to implement the tool box and the test application.
       Here are the recommended steps for a UNIX system. Vary this according
       to the requirements of your OS and compiler.  You will find it
       simplest to work if you place the CIFtbx2 files together in a 
       common subdirectory named 'ciftbx.src'.   Be very careful if you 
       place them in a directory with other files, since some of the build 
       and test instructions remove or overwrite existing files, especially 
       with extensions such as '.o', '.lst', '.diff' or '.new'.
<PRE>
       *** ========================================================== ***
       *** ========================================================== ***
       *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are running on a SUN or similar system  &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
       *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; which treats floating point underflow as an    &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
       *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; error, you may need to use clearfp_sun.f       &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
       *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; Please read the following paragraph carefully  &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
       *** ========================================================== ***
       *** ========================================================== ***
</PRE>
<P>
       Before building the code, you may wish to replace the file 'clearfp.f'
       with code appropriate to your system.  The routine is called by
       ciftbx to clear possible floating point underflows which may be
       generated when the code attempts to find the number of digits of
       precision supported on your system.  No special action is required
       to clear an underflow on many systems, but on a SUN, for example,
       execution of the code to test machine precision generates messages
       about underflow and inexact arithmetic.  On a SUN, these messages
       may be avoided by replacing 'clearfp.f' by 'clearfp_sun.f'.  On
       other machines sensitive to underflow, you may have to use
       other (usually similar) code.
<P>
       On a UNIX system, most of what you need to do to build and test
       CIFtbx2 is laid out in Makefile.  *** Be sure to examine
       and edit this file appropriately before using it.***  But, once
       properly edited, all you should need to do is 'make clean' to
       remove old object files, 'make all' to build new versions of
       'ciftbx.o', etc., and 'make tests' to test what you have built. 
       Note that the Makefile takes some initial action to force mkdecompln
       and rmdecompln to be executable.  See the section marked postshar.

       ***Note*** to execute the supplied example applications 'tbx_ex.f'
       and 'tbx_exm.f' identically to the test outputs supplied, a copy of
       the CIF Core Dictionary version 2.1beta5 'cif_core.dic' (for 'tbx_ex') and of the
       macromolecular CIF dictionary version 1.0.00 'cif_mm.dic' must
       be available in your work area. If they are not the tests will proceed
       with a warning message but no validations checks will occur. A copy of 
       the dictionary 'cif_core.dic' can be obtained from iucr.  A copy of
       'cif_mm.dic' can be obtained from obtained from the mmCIF link on
       'http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/'.  Once you have both dictionaries,
       compress them, and edit the definitions of MMDICPATH and COREDICPATH
       in Makefile to agree with the permanent locations of the formerly
       uncompressed dictionaries.  The Makefile will create local
       soft links to temporary uncompressed copies of the dictionaries.
       If you can afford the space for permanent uncompressed copies,
       change the definition to EXPAND in Makefile to a non-temporary
       directory, such as '.'  To exceute the new example program 'tbx_ex3.f'
       identically to the test outputs supplied, a copy of the June 2006
       version of the expanded version of the DDLm CIF core dictionary
       is needed as cif_expanded.dic.

    4. WHAT NEXT
</H3>
       You are now ready to implement CIFtbx for your software applications.
       Note that it more efficient to compile 'ciftbx.f' separately and add
       'ciftbx.o' at link time. Note that the line &quot;include 'ciftbx.cmn'&quot;
       MUST appear at the start of any routine invoking the CIFtbx commands.

    5. CHANGES
</H3>
<H3>
       CHANGES FROM CIFTBX3 TO CIFTBX4
</H3>
<P>
       The 4.1.0 release was the first stable release of CIFtbx 4.
       The 4.1.1 release added support for html output from cif2cif.
       The major changes in CIFtbx4 over CIFtbx 3 have been to
       support reading and writing the bracketed constructs
       of DDLm.  These are optionally supported in reading any cif 
       by turning on the flags rdbkt_, rdbrc_ and rdprn_ for
       recognitions of square brackets, braces and parentheses
       respectively.  The CIF 2 behavior of not checking the
       characters after a closing quote mark can also be turned
       on with rdrcqt_.  Recognition of mutiline strings quoted
       with treble quotes is under the control of rdtq_.  In
       order to use CIF 2 tables in which elements of the
       form "key":value are used, rdcolon_ must be turned on.
       In order to ensure upwards compatability, all these features
       default to being off.
       
       If all or some of brackets, braces or parentheses are enabled,
       the bracketed constructs are read very much like text fields,
       except that for a bracketed construct, in order to see if
       more information may be available, you check depth_. rather
       than text_.  depth_ is an integer variable which returns 0 when
       not parsing a bracketed construct.  If it is non-zero then
       additional calls to test_ or char_ or numb_ or numd_ will be
       needed to see the next element.  If depth_ returns to 0 after
       such a call, then there really was no next element.≈
       See the cif2cif packages for detailed sample code of how to
       read and write bracketed constructs.

       After release of a first release candidate on 29 November 2009, and
       and testing by Joe Krahn, a second release candidate was prepared
       on 6 December 2009 to remove compiler warnings and uninitialized
       variables.  The  result release should produce clean compilations
       with g77 and g95 and with gfortran from gcc 4.4, as well as g77 and
       g95 from gcc 4.4.  There is an undiagnosed segmentation fault with
       gfortran from gcc 4.2.

<H3>
       CHANGES FROM CIFTBX2 to CIFTBX3
</H3>
       CIFtbx3 is being created from CIFtbx2 in response to the changes
       in the CIF specification from the original 80 character line
       CIF 1.0 specification to the new CIF 1.1 specification that
       allows for lines of up to 2048 characters.  CIFtbx2 allowed
       for lines longer than 80 characters, but suffered from performance
       limitations when used with lines as long as 2048 characters.
       CIFtbx3 addresses those problems, and adds code to support the
       line folding anf unfolding conventions of CIF 1.1.  The
       new control variables fold_, pfold_ and unfold_ have been
       added.  If unfold_ is .false. (the default), processing if
       an input CIF is as in CIFtbx2.  A folded comment or text field
       will be presented to the application in its folded form.  As
       a convenience to the application programmer when processing
       text fields, the control variable fold_ will be set to true if
       the text field started with the ';\' fold indicator.  If unfold_ 
       is .true. then comments and text fields that have been folded 
       in an input CIF will be presented to the application in
       unfolded form.  Release 3.0.0 is a pre-release for community
       testing of the long-line code.  Additional CIF integrity checks
       are planned for future CIFtbx3 releases.
<P>
       The work on CIFtbx3 has been supported in part by funding from
       the International Union of Crystallography.
<H3>
       CHANGES FROM CIFTBX to CIFTBX2
</H3>
       CIFtbx2 was created from CIFtbx in response to the development of the
       Macromolecular CIF dictionary [Paula Fitzgerald, Helen Berman,
       Phil Bourne, Brian McMahon, Keith Watenpaugh, John Westbrook, 
       &quot;cifdic.m95&quot;, COMCIFS, 1995] and version 2.1.0 of the Dictionary
       Description Language [John Westbrook, Sydney Hall, &quot;Draft DDL 
       V 2.1.0&quot;, COMCIFS, 1995].  Since mmCIF and DDL 2.1.0 were carefully
       designed to ease migration from the core CIF dictionaries and
       DDL 1.4, very little in CIFtbx had to be changed, and the user
       interface remains virtually identical.  The major issues that
       had to be dealt with were the greatly increased size of the
       dictionary, the rigorous use of categories to structure names, and
       and new system of aliases to ensure compatibility with older
       dictionaries.  The use of save-frames in dictionaries and the
       presence of names longer than 32 characters also had to be dealt with.
<P>
       There were two issues to address in the changes in size of the
       dictionary and of names:  allocating appropriate storage and
       preserving efficiency of the code execution.  New parameters were
       introduced for the size-dependent changes, so that future changes
       can go more smoothly.  Efficiency is achieved by extensive use
       of hash-table-controlled lists.  There had been a little use of
       a hash table in prior CIFtbx versions.  All major lists of names
       are now controlled by hash tables.  The routines used can be found
       in 'hash_funcs.f'.  Ordinarily the user should not have to deal
       directly with these routines.  The only change that might be made for
       tuning would be to adjust the parameter &quot;NUMHASH&quot; in 'ciftbx.sys'.
       This is presently set 53, which would mean, for up to 2500 names,
       typical searches for name matches would look at sub-lists to less than
       50 names.  Greater timing efficiency can be achieved at a slight 
       expense in memory by increasing &quot;NUMHASH&quot; to some larger number.
       It is recommended that a prime be used for best efficiency in
       distribution of names among sub-lists.
<P>
       In addition to &quot;NUMHASH&quot;, the other size-control parameters in
       'ciftbx.sys' are:
<PRE>
       NUMCHAR -- the maximum number of characters in a name (default 80)
       NUMDICT -- the maximum number of names in all dictionaries
                  (default 2500)  [Note:Increased to 3200 in Release 2.5.4]
       NUMBLOCK - the maximum number of names in a data block (default 500)
       NUMLOOP -- the maximum number of loops in a data block (default 50)
       NUMITEM -- the maximum number of items in a loop (default 50)
       MAXBUF  -- the maximum number of characters in a line (default 200)
</PRE>
<P>
       The maximum number of categories is also controlled by NUMDICT,
       but does not compete for space with ordinary names.
<P>
       ***** WARNING *****
       IF YOU CHANGE NUMCHAR OR MAXBUF YOU MUST CHANGE THEM IN BOTH
       'ciftbx.cmn' AND IN 'ciftbx.sys' IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ALIGNMENT
       OF COMMON BLOCKS [Note: Corrected in Release 2.4.5]
<P>
       Starting with release 2.5.5, two additional parameters control
       the size of the memory cache for the direct access file:
<PRE>
       NUMPAGE -- the number of memory resident pages (default 10)
       NUMCPP  -- the number of characters per page (default 16384)
</PRE>
<P>
       The number of characters per page must be at least MAXBUF and,
       normally should be much larger.
<P>
       Starting with the release of CIFtbx version 2.6.4, additional parameters for
       control of compression by run length encoding (RLE) and for control of
       caching are provided:
<PRE>
       XXFLAG  -- the flag character for RLE (default '`')
       XXRADIX -- the radix for RLE digit encoding (default 64)
       NUMCIP  -- the number of characters per index pointer (default 8)
</PRE>

<P>
       The most extensive changes were made to the routine &quot;dict_&quot;, to
       recognize categories and check dictionaries for consistency
       among categories, save-frame or data-block names and item names.
       We wanted to preserve the handling of older dictionaries.  This
       led to some compromises with the most rigorous checking.  The
       oldest dictionary in question, 'cifdic.c91' does not use
       categories at all, and often names items as superstrings of
       data-block names.  The most recent core dictionary, 'cif_core.dic'
       uses categories, naming them explicitly.  In that case we can
       expect an unlooped name in a block to start with the category.
       The new mmCIF dictionary provides a clear break in item names
       with a &quot;.&quot; between the category name and the rest of an item
       name, a condition for which we can and do check.  We therefore
       make the assumption that a dictionary for which no categories
       were explicitly defined is one for which no categories need
       be checked, but if a dictionary defines any categories explicitly,
       we check each name to ensure that some category has been
       explicitly or implicitly assigned.  Since the possibility exists
       of many messages on mismatches, we have introduced &quot;ciftbx
       warning&quot; messages similar to the &quot;ciftbx error&quot; message, but
       which allow continued execution.  In the ALPHA version no further
       checks of categories were done after the dictionary check.
       In this version the names used in a loop are checked for
       consistency, provided categories were defined at all.

<H3>
       CHANGES WITHIN CIFTBX3
</H3>
<P>
       The 3.0.3 release tightened timing by making more
	   use of counted character string segments.  In
	   preparation for the 3.1 release, the names of
	   many of the internal utility routines are being 
	   changed to a uniform naming convention in which
	   internal names for the library begin with tbxx.

	   <P>
	   The number of memory resident pages was increased
	   from 5 to 200 and the page size from 3072 to 8192
	   characters per page.
<P>
       The 3.0.2 release corrected an error in the index
       handling in dtype_ and added code for the additional
       types from the PDB exchange dictionary.
<P>

       The 3.0.1 release added the function dtype_ to return the
	   dictionary type of a data name, and allowed the variable
	   quote_ to be returned from cmnt_ and used to control the
	   behavior of pcmnt_.  Both changes were need for release
	   1.0.1 of cif2cif.
<P>

       CHANGES WITHIN CIFTBX2
</H3>
<p>
       The 2.6.4 release added new code for XML output and for run-length
       encoding and cacheing.  The new logical variables xmlout_ and
       xmlong_ control the use of XML output.  The default for xmlout_
       is .false. to indicate normal CIF output.  If xmlout_ is set
       .true. the output routines are changed to produce XML style
       output.  The conversion of CIF tag names to XML is controlled
       by xmlong_.  If xmlong_ is .true. (the default), the XML
       tags are the CIF tags with the leading '_' removed.  Otherwise
       and attempt is made to strip the leading category as well.
       The logic for testing machine precision was changed to allow 
       for higher single and double precision.  In addition, dictionaries
       may contain _xml_mapping.token, .token_type and .target items
       to provide for mapping of CIF tags to parametrized strings.
       The logic of the test programs has been changed to initialize
       standard deviations for numb_ to zero.  This corrects an error
       in the test outputs on some machines.  In addition, in June
       2002 the release was updated to correct an error introduced in
       the 2.6.3 release in the handling of negative exponents.  Our
       thanks to James Hester for the correction.
<p>
       The 2.6.3 release corrected an error processing some numbers
       on input. 
<p>
       The 2.6.2 release corrected some typos the new code for
       category key checking introduced in release 2.6.
<p>
       The 2.6.1 release suppressed the warning messages for the core
       dictionary caused by data blocks for groups of tags with no data
       type defined for the block name, but where the block name ends in
       an underscore.

       The 2.6 release added the variables esddig_ and pesddig_ to
       monitor and control the number of esd digits when esdlim_ is
       negative.  Processing of category key values has been added.
<p>
       The 2.5.5 release increased the speed of CIFtbx by creating a
       large in-core cache for the direct access file.  The new
       parameters NUMPAGE and NUMCPP control the cache size.  New 
       variables append_, recbeg_ and recend_ were added.  Logic in dict_
       was changed to suppress category warnings from cif_core.dic.  The
       pdata_ logic was changed to allow duplicate data blocks to be
       written.  The logic form numb_ and numd_ was modified to ensure
       accurate handling of 90.000.
<P>
       The 2.5.4 release increased NUMDICT to 3200 to accomodate the
       release 0.9.01 cif_mm.dic dictionary when loaded along with
       cif_core.dic.  The definition of esdlim_ was extended to allow
       for cases reported by John C.Bollinger &lt;jobollin@indiana.edu&gt; so that
       a negative esdlim_ would permit esd's in the range [1,-esdlim_].
       The new variables decp_, pdecp_, lzero_ and plzero_ were added
       to allow finer control over the presentation of numbers.  All
       test cases were updated to use the current dictionaries.  Some
       of the control code logic in dict_ was corrected and new codes
       'catck' and 'catno' were added to turn category checking on and
       off.
<P>

       The 2.5.3 release added logic for minimal processing of &quot;global_&quot;.
       The new variable &quot;glob_&quot; is set true when a global is encountered.
       The variable &quot;globo_&quot; may be set try to force &quot;pdata_&quot; to output
       a global section instead of a data block.  As with the save frame code,
       the global section code is a minimal implementation sufficient to handle
       dictionaries which use global sections.  This code is not intended
       to support use of global sections within your CIFs.  A bug in the
       processing of a text block with characters in the first line when the
       text block was the first value in a loop was fixed.  The code to change
       the quotation character on a string containing that character was
       modified to test only for the case of a blank following the character.

<P>
       The 2.5.2 release fixed a string subscript error in putstr.  The
       new variables nblank_ and nblanko_ were added to allow control
       of the handling of quoted blank fields.  Logic was added to
       avoid warning messages when the category_overview category is used 
       in cifdic.c96.  Added the variable tbxver_ (the CIFtbx version and 
       date in the form 'CIFtbx version N.N.N, DD MMM YY '.
<P>
       The 2.5.1 release added calls to the routine clearfp to allow
       floating point exceptions to be cleared after testing for
       machine precision.  In addition, the common blocks were
       reorganized to avoid warning messages on systems sensitive
       to unreferenced variables.  The file 'ciftbx.cmn' includes the
       two new files 'ciftbx.cmv' for variable definitions and
       'ciftbx.cmf' for function definitions, and 'ciftbx.sys'
       includes 'ciftbx.cmv', but not 'ciftbx.cmf'.  For use on systems
       with FreeBSD, the code in putnum was changed to allow for trailing
       blanks in writes of floating point fields.
<P>
       The 2.5.0 release was a major change to CIFtbx.  New variables
       were been added to allow controlled use of the horizontal
       tab character in both input and output.  The user now has the
       the option of processing tabs as recognizable characters or
       to expand them to blanks on tab stops every 8 character positions.
       Two new routines were added.  The command &quot;bkmrk_(mark)&quot; sets
       or finds bookmarks in an input cif.  The command 
       &quot;find_(name,type,string)&quot; searches an input cif.  The logic of
       &quot;ploop_&quot; was changed to allow the &quot;loop_&quot; to be placed in
       and output CIF without a data item name, so that comments may
       follow.  The position of the &quot;loop_&quot; is now controlled by
       &quot;pposval_&quot;, if given.  The recognition of columns of mixed numeric and
       character data was changed.  Such columns are now treated as being
       character data, even for the numeric data items.  The processing
       of rows with mixed categories was changed to produce fewer
       and clearer warning messages.  The command &quot;pchar_(string)&quot;
       accepts a string consisting of &quot;char(0)&quot; as a command to terminate
       the current output cif line.
<P>
       The 2.4.6 release fixed deficiencies and bugs found in
       testing release 2.4.5 (esp. by SRH).  New variables
       were added to allow precise position of output, and
       the original upper/lower case versions of data item
       names are now retained and returned.  A bug in
       reporting dictionary validation errors  was fixed.
<P>
       The 2.4.5 release was a significant revision to CIFtbx2 to
       support cif2cif.  The processing of numbers was extensively
       revised and support for the reading and writing of comments
       was provided.  The changes are as follows:
<P>
       New routines, numd_ and pnumd_ were provided to read and
       write double precision numbers with esd's.  The new
       variable esdlim_ controls the writing of esd's.  The processing
       of numbers being read was expanded to allow scientific
       notation with E, D, or Q.
<P>
       New routines, cmnt_ and pcmnt_ were provided to read and
       write comments.  A new routine, prefx_ allows each line
       of an output CIF to have characters prefixed.  A new variable,
       tabl_ controls the use of tab stops in loop output.
<P>
       The logic of char_ was revised to allow &quot;.&quot; and &quot;?&quot; to be
       read as character strings rather than type null, distinguishing
       this case from unquoted period or question mark.  Text fields
       which begin in the first line are now recognized.
<P>
       The logic of pchar_ was revised to ensure quotation of fields
       which might be confused with numbers in scientific notation,
       and to allow output of &quot;.&quot; and &quot;?&quot; per se.  When necessary,
       the character data is converted to text.
<P>
       The behavior of the routine test_ was changed to force an
       advance through a loop when the same field is tested
       again.
<P>
       The internal routine putstr was revised to avoid excess
       whitespace when flushing lines and to support the
       variable tabl_ to force internal alignment of columns
       in loops to tab stops determined by the column number.
<P>
       The common blocks were cleaned up and consolidated.
       The parameter MAXTAB was defined to control the arrays
       for non-loop tab stops.  The duplications between
       ciftbx.sys and ciftbx.cmn were removed, and ciftbx.sys
       call new forces and include of ciftbx.cmn.
<P>
       The 2.4.4 release corrects two bugs.  A mispositioning of
       an input CIF occurred if the data values in a loop included two
       consecutive text fields with no intervening blank.  This has
       been corrected.  Also, the output routines failed to limit
       output CIFs to 80 columns unless MAXBUF was set to 80.  The
       meaning of line_ has now been extended to have effect as a
       right margin for output as well as for input.  A warning
       message is issued for the rare cases where an output string
       which cannot be fit into the number of columns specified
       by line_, even by starting a new line.  Finally, the internal
       arrays used by the subroutine getitm to keep track of positions
       within loops have been moved to a common block to facilitate
       some changes now under consideration.  
<P>
       The 2.4.3 release includes two minor changes from the 2.4.2
       release.  First, the two new data types, &quot;line&quot; and &quot;uline&quot;
       introduced in the transition to cifdic.m96 version 0.8.0 are
       recognized.  Second, a blank file name is permitted in
       opening a cif, in which case a fortran &quot;open&quot; statement will
       not be executed within CIFtbx for the file, so that the
       open may be controlled by the calling routines.  This has
       proven useful in writing filters.
<P>
       The 2.4.2 release includes minor cleanups to remove variables
       which are no longer used and a suppression of a report of
       conflicting types in loading multiple dictionaries when no
       type checking is being done.  The Makefile has been improved
       to include execution of tests with 'make tests', to allow
       rebuilding of ciftbx.shar and ciftbx.cshar with 'make shars',
       and to clean up the directory with 'make clean.'   The files
       for CYCLOPS2 and related changes to the Makefile were
       introduced.  See 'README.cyclops' and the comments in 'cyclops.f'.
<P>
       The 2.4.1 release includes a fix to work around the strict
       interpretation of the ansi Fortran standard used by some compilers
       in handling write statements with concatenation of strings with
       inherited lengths.  This caused a compilation failure in cifmsg.
<P>
       With the 2.4 release, new arguments were added to dict_.  The
       file name may be blank to allow calls which only set flags.  The
       list of flags was extended to include 'reset' to turn off
       previously set flags for validity or type checking and 'close'
       to remove all dictionary information and reset the checking flags.
       A new routine, purge_, was added to close an open input CIF
       and clear all related data structures (but not the dictionary)
<P>
       With the 2.3 release the handling of aliases changed a
       little.  The control of use of aliases was split between the
       logical variables &quot;alias_&quot; (which when true allows routines
       to recognize aliased names) and &quot;aliaso_&quot; which when true allows
       the output routines to output the preferred aliases from the
       dictionary chosen.  The variables &quot;tagname_&quot;, &quot;dicname_&quot;, &quot;diccat_&quot;
       and &quot;dictype_&quot; were added to provide the CIF input tagname,
       the preferred name, the category and the dictionary type.
       In release 2.2 the last three were called &quot;dname_&quot;, &quot;dcat_&quot; and
       &quot;dtype_&quot; (see below)
<P>
       With the 2.2 release, the variable, &quot;dcat_&quot; (now &quot;diccat_&quot;) was defined
       in the common blocks in 'ciftbx.cmn' to hold the category of the
       last data item processed by &quot;test_&quot;  The special category &quot;(none)&quot;
       may be reported when no category can be found.
<P>
       The use of aliases in releases 2.0 and 2.1 was handled by adding 
       lists of alias pointers for names.  There are two pointers:  &quot;alias&quot;
       either holds a zero if there is no next alias, or a pointer to the
       next alias, and &quot;aroot&quot; which is zero for the root definition or
       a pointer to the root definition if this is an alias.  The new
       logical &quot;aroot_&quot; (now &quot;aliaso_&quot;) controls output use of aliases.  
       If &quot;aliaso_&quot; is true then when a request is made to output
       a name, the preferred alias named provided by the dictionary,
       if any, is substituted.  If &quot;aroot_&quot; is false, then the name given
       by the user is used.  The default is the release is for &quot;aroot_&quot; to
       be true.  If a change is needed, it is available in 'ciftbx.cmn'.
       In addition, for the full 2.2 release, a new variable, &quot;daroot_&quot; was
       added to the common blocks in 'ciftbx.cmn' which holds the name
       of the data item of which the data item for which the last call
       to &quot;test_&quot; is an alias.  This report is independent of the setting of
       &quot;aroot_&quot; but does depend on the data item actually being present in
       the CIF being processed, not just in the dictionary (which must, of
       course, also be present).
<P>
       As of release 2.3, the default for &quot;aliaso_&quot; is false, and &quot;daroot_&quot;
       has been renamed &quot;dicname&quot;.  In most cases, &quot;dicname&quot; will be
       properly set in release 2.3, etc. even if the name is _not_ in the
       input CIF.
<P>
       The use of save-frames was handled by including a logical &quot;save_&quot; to
       flag a data block as being a save frame.  Minor changes were made
       in the routine 'data_' to set &quot;save_&quot; true at the start of a save
       frame (i.e. when a non-blank name is given), and to recognize the
       end of a save frame (i.e. when the name is blank).  A warning is
       issued if the start and end are not consistently used.
<P>
       The handling of long lines has been changed.  Prior versions of
       CIFtbx clipped all lines at 80 characters.  The hard clipping is
       now controlled by the parameter MAXBUF (default 200), with a
       warning issued for lines longer than the number of characters
       specified by the variable line_ (initially set to 80).  Characters
       are processed even if they are in character positions after the
       warning limit set by line_.  In some cases, text lines which were
       returned by &quot;char_&quot; with a length of 80 will now be returned with
       a different length.  The new code scans for the last non-blank
       character on the line, searching as far as MAXBUF.  In most cases
       the reported value will be less than in the past, reflecting the
       length of the line with trailing blanks stripped.
<P>
       The mmCIF dictionary specifies a much wider range of item types than
       had been the case in the past.  To ensure upward compatibility,
       CIFtbx maps all of the known item types to one of the primitive
       types:  char, numb, text or null.  With the 2.2 release, access
       to the more precise type is provide by the variable &quot;dtype_&quot; in
       the common blocks in 'ciftbx.cmn'  &quot;dtype_&quot; is set when &quot;test_&quot; is
       called and the data item name is found in the CIF as well as in
       the dictionary.
<H3>
       KNOWN PROBLEMS
</H3>
       There is no way to read a comment on a data name in a loop
       data name list, or between the loop data names and the
       first data item.
<P>
       There is no way to read data items within a data block after
       the completion of embedded save frames.  Until this problem
       is corrected, save frames should be placed last within a
       data block and a new data block started for further information.
<P>
       The command pchar_ forces quote marks around any string
       which might be confused with a number.
