 CYCLOPS2 is a fortran program for checking STAR data names against data
 -------- name dictionaries written in DDL-STAR format proposed by Tony Cook
          of ORAC Ltd., Leeds. Data names may be checked in any text file.

In order to ensure continuing availability of source code and

This does not prevent you from using
the program, from making copies and changes,
but prevents the creation of &quot;closed source&quot; versions

<P>
Science is best served
when the tools we use are fully understood by those who wield those
tools and by those who make used of results obtained with those tools.
When a scientific tool exists as software, access to source code is
an important element in achieving full understanding of that tool.
As our field evolves and new versions of software are required,
access to source allows us to adapt our tools quickly and effectively.
<P>
<P>
In the early days of software development,
most scientific software source code was freely and openly shared with a
minimum of formalities.  These days, it appears that carefully drawn
legal documents are necessary to protect free access to the source
code of scientific software.  We are all deeply indebted to
<a href="http://www.stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a> for showing
us how a creative combination of copyrights and seemingly restrictive
licenses could give us truly unfettered freedom to use programs,
to read their source code and to develop new versions.  The
<a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux project</a> have shown that
an open source approach works.  We use the GNU General Public
License
(the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">&quot;GPL&quot;</a>)

for use have correctly been called &quot;GPL-like&quot;.
<P>
If you are a user of this program, you will find that
the copyrights and notices ask little more of you than that you
avoid mistakes by others by keeping the notices with copies,
display scientific integrity by citing your sources properly and
treating this like other shared scientific developments by not
inferring a warranty.  If you are a software developer and wish to
incorporate what you
find here into new code, or to pick up bits and pieces and used them
in another context, the situation becomes more complex.  Read the
copyrights and notices carefully.  You will find that they are
&quot;infectious&quot;.  <b>Whatever you make from our Open Source code
must itself be offered as Open Source code.</b>  In addition, in
order to allow users to understand what has changed and to ensure
orderly development you have to describe your changes.

<P>
This version of CYCLOPS is released with CIFtbx2.  Before reading this
document, please read the CIFtbx2 README file.  The basic instructions for
building CYCLOPS2 are included with those for building CIFtbx2.  Additional
information needed for the installation of CYCLOPS appears in the
section INSTALLATION NOTES, below.  If you are on a UNIX system, the 
Makefile for CIFtbx2 can be used to build and test cyclops.

<H3>
PROGRAM OPERATION
</H3>
CYCLOPS reads the text containing data names from the standard input device
(normally device 5). One or more STAR data name dictionaries (in DDL format)
are opened (normally from unit 1).  A report on the data names is output to
the standard output device (normally device 6).  Messages are output to the
standard error device (normally device 0).  If an error is encountered in
attempting to write to the standard error device, further messages output
is diverted to the standard output device.
<P>
NOTE:  If no dictionaries are specified on the command line, an attempt
is made to open a file named &quot;STARDICT&quot; to use either as a dictionary or 
from which to obtain a list of names of dictionaries.
<P>
STARDICT may directly contain a dictionary as in version 1 of CYCLOPS, or
contain a list of file names of dictionaries, one per line.  In that case
the list must begin with the line for which the first 5 characters are
&quot;#DICT&quot;.  The list of unreferenced data names is suppressed unless
the line &quot;#VERBOSE&quot; appears in STARDICT, or the command line argument
&quot;-v yes&quot; is used.

<P>
In a UNIX-like environment, the program is run as:
<PRE>
     cyclops [-i input_text] [-o validation_output] \
         [-d dictionary] [-p priority] [-c catck] \
         [-f command_file] [-v verbose] [-s short]\
     where:
         input_text defaults to $CYCLOPS_INPUT_TEXT or stdin
         validation_output defaults to $CYCLOPS_VALIDATION_OUT or stdout
         dictionary defaults to $CYCLOPS_CHECK_DICTIONARY
           (multiple dictionaries may be specified)
           input_text of &quot;-&quot; is stdin, validation_output of 
           &quot;-&quot; is stdout
         -c has values of t or 1 or y vs. f or 0 or n,
           (default f, i.e. no category checking),
         -v has values of t or 1 or y vs. f or 0 or n,
           (default f, i.e. non-verbose),
         -s has values of t or 1 or y vs. f or 0 or n,
           (default f, i.e. not short),
           short restricts output to items not in dictionaries
         -p has values of first, final or nodup 
           (default first for first dictionary has priority)
         a command file may contain additional arguments
</PRE>

<H3>
1.  INSTALLATION
</H3>
Here is the recommended procedure for implementing and testing this
version of cyclops.
<P>
1.0.  Before you try to install this version of cyclops2
<PRE>   
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; You must have ciftbx version 2.5.4 or greater  &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; installed in a directory named ciftbx.src.     &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; The scripts mkdecompln and rmdecompln, which   &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; come with ciftbx, must be installed in the     &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; top level directory and executable.            &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; To test cyclops, you must have compressed      &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; copies of cif_core.dic and cif_mm.dic installed&lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; in a directory named dictionaries.             &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
      *** ========================================================== ***
</PRE>
    The directory structure within which you will work is
<PRE>
                  top level directory
                  -------------------
                           |
                           |
            ------------------------------
            |              |             | 
       dictionaries   ciftbx.src     cyclops.src
       ------------   ----------     -----------
</PRE>
            

<P>
   You may have acquired this package in one of several forms.
   The most likely are as a &quot;C-shell Archive,&quot; a &quot;Shell Archive&quot;,
   or as separate files.  The idea is to get to separate files,
   all in the same directory, named cyclops.src, parallel to
   the directory ciftbx.src, but let's start with the possibility
   that you got the package as one big file, i.e. in one of
   the archive file formats.  Place the archive in the top level
   directory.
<PRE>
     *** ========================================================== ***
     *** ========================================================== ***
     *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; The files in this kit will unpack into a       &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
     *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; directory named cyclops.src.  It is a good idea&lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
     *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; to save the current contents of cyclops.src    &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
     *** ==&gt;&gt;&gt; and then to make the directory empty           &lt;&lt;&lt;== ***
     *** ========================================================== ***
     *** ========================================================== ***
</PRE>
   If you are on a machine which does not provide a unix-like shell,
   you will need to take apart the archive by hand using a text
   editor.  We'll get to that in a moment.
<P>
   1.1.  ON A UNIX MACHINE
<P>
   If you have the shell archive on a unix machine, follow the
   instructions at the front of the archive, i.e. save the
   uncompressed archive file as &quot;file&quot;, then, if the archive 
   is a &quot;Shell Archive&quot; execute &quot;sh file&quot;.  If the archive is 
   a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot; execute &quot;csh file&quot;.
<P>
   1.2. IF YOU DON'T HAVE UNIX
<P>
   If sh or csh are not available, then it is best to start with the
   &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot; and do the steps that follow.  If you must
   use the &quot;Shell Archive&quot; you should be aware that the lines
   you want to extract have been prefixed with &quot;X&quot;, while most of
   the lines you want to discard have not.  For a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot;
   such prefixes are rare and the file is easier to read.  Assume
   you have a &quot;C-Shell Archive&quot;.
<P>
   Use your editor to separate the different parts of the file into
   individual files in your workspace. Each part starts with
   a lot of unixisms, then several blank lines and then two lines
   which identify the file, and most importantly, contain the
   text &quot;CUT_HERE_CUT_HERE_CUT_HERE&quot;  You can look at the line
   before and the line after to see if you are at the head or
   tail of a file.  Use your editor to search for the &quot;CUT_HERE&quot;
   lines. Each part is carefully labeled and indicates the  
   recommended filename for the separated file. On some machines
   these filenames may need to be altered to suit the OS or compiler.
<P>
   1.3.  <A HREF="MANIFEST.html">MANIFEST</A>

</PRE>
<H3>     
2. COMPILING AND EXECUTING
</H3>
   Here are the recommended steps for a UNIX system. Vary this 
   according to the requirements of your OS and compiler.  You will find
   it simplest to work if you place the cyclops files together in a 
   common subdirectory named 'cyclops.src'.   Be very careful if you 
   place them in a directory with other files, since some of the build 
   and test instructions remove or overwrite existing files, especially 
   with extensions such as '.o', '.lst',  or '.diff'.  On a UNIX system,
   most of what you need to do to build and test cyclops is laid out in 
   Makefile.  *** Be sure to examine and edit this file appropriately 
   before using it.***  But, once properly edited, all you should need 
   to do is 'make clean' to remove old object files, 'make all' to 
   build new version of 'cyclops' and 'make tests' to test what you
   have built.
<P>
   For non-UNIX-like environments, you will have to provide 
   replacements for iargc, getarg and getenv.  The following are
   reasonable possibilities:
<PRE>
          integer function iargc(dummy)
          iargc=1
          return
          end
  
          subroutine getarg(narg,string)
          integer narg
          character*(*) string
          string=char(0)
          if (narg.eq.1) string='-vn'
          return
          end

          subroutine getenv(evar,string)
          character*(*) evar,string
          string=char(0)
          if(evar.eq.&quot;CYCLOPS_INPUT_TEXT&quot;)
         *  string='STARTEXT'//char(0)
          if(evar.eq.&quot;CYCLOPS_VALIDATION_OUT&quot;)
         *  string='STARCHEK'//char(0)
          if(evar.eq.&quot;CYCLOPS_CHECK_DICTIONARY&quot;) 
         *  string=char(0)
          return
          end
</PRE>
<P>
   This combination of substitute routines would &quot;wire-in&quot; CYCLOPS2 to
   read its input text from a file named STARTEXT, write the
   validations output to a file named STARCHEK, and check names 
   against the default dictionary or file listing dictionaries
   STARDICT
<P>
   Note that the PARAMETER 'MAXBUF' should contain the maximum number 
   of characters contained on a single text line. The default value is
   200.
<P>
   
   If you don't wish to use the Makefile or can't, then here are
   the essential steps to build cyclops:
<P>
   (a) compile 'cyclops.f' [note that you will need the files 
          'cyclops.cmn', 'ciftbx.cmn', ciftbx.cmv', 'ciftbx.cmf', and 
          'ciftbx.sys' in the same directory as cyclops.f, or you will
          need to change the fortran includes.]
<P>
   (b) if you hove not already done so, compile 'ciftbx.f' and 
       'hash_funcs.f' to create the object files 'ciftbx.o' 
       and 'hash_funcs.o'.
<P>   
   (c) link 'cyclops.o', 'ciftbx.o' and 'hash_funcs.o' together 
       to make the program 'cyclops'
<P>
   (d) if at all possible, please test cyclops by creating a file named 
       'STARDICT' with the three lines
<PRE>   
       #DICT
       cif_core.dic
       cif_mm.dic
</PRE>	   
	   and place a copy of cif_core.dic and of cif_mm.dic into the same 
	   directory.  Then execute the command
<PRE>		
       ./cyclops mtest.prt STARCHEK 2&gt; cyclops_test.lst
</PRE>	
	   Compare STARCHEK to 'mtest.cyc' and 'cyclops_test.lst' to 
	   'cyclops_test.prt'  There should not be any differences.
<P>	      
	(e) if you have any problems with this process please report them to
        Herbert J. Bernstein [em: yaya@bernstein-plus-sons.com,

WARNING
</H3>
There were major changes to CYCLOPS2 in the transition to version 2.1.0.
In addition to major restructuring of the output, input and output
files are handled very differently.  CYCLOPS2 now reads the input
text file from the standard input file, writes the report to the standard
output file, and writes messages to the standard error file.  The redirection
to specific files in UNIX may be given either by listing the source and
target filenames on the command line or by using &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;.  This makes
is easier to use CYCLOPS2 as a &quot;filter&quot; in UNIX-like environments, but
invalidates jobs which depend on the former CYCLOPS2 behavior inherited
from CYCLOPS:  writing the report to a file named &quot;STARCHEK&quot; and messages
to the standard output file.  For example, if, on a UNIX system, under
sh, you had a command line of the form:
<PRE>
    cyclops &lt; text &gt; summary
</PRE>
the new command line could be
<PRE>
    cyclops text STARCHEK 2&gt; summary
</PRE>
<H3>
CHANGES
</H3>
CYCLOPS2 works very much that same way CYCLOPS version 1 works.  However,
the dictionary processing, for good or ill, is now that used by CIFtbx2.
This means that some user-defined dictionaries which do not follow
CIF-style dictionary practices may produce warning messages.  We had
to make this change to be able to find all the name definitions in the
newer DDL2-based dictionaries, since some names definitions are
embedded in loops quite remote from the defining tags.
<P>
The STARCHEK output has been reorganized to be more practical with very
large dictionaries.  The list of data names not defined in any dictionary
now comes first.  This is followed by the data names which are both
defined and referenced.  Finally, the names which are defined but not
referenced are listed.
<P>
The number of line numbers listed for any name has been reduced from
99 to 19.  If there are more than 19 lines on which a name is used,
this is indicated after the 10th line number by &quot;..&quot; with the first
10 and the last 9 line numbers being explicitly given.
<P>
To avoid having to copy large dictionaries and to allow for multiple,
layered dictionaries, the file STARDICT may optionally contain a list
of paths to dictionaries to load.  To distinguish this case from a
dictionary loaded directly from STARDICT, the first 5 characters of
STARTDICT must be &quot;#DICT&quot; followed by a list of dictionary file names,
one per line.  If the dictionaries are not in the same directory, give
full path names to the proper directories.
<P>
     ***** WARNING ***** CYCLOPS2 will overwrite an existing STARCHEK file
without warning messages.
<P>
Release 2.1.5 adapted CYCLOPS2 to CIFtbx 4.1.0 to start the conversion to
handling of DDLm dictionaries when they become available.
<P>
Release 2.1.4 restored the missing code for the &quot;-f command-file&quot;
command line option.  Examples were changed to use cif_core.dic and
cif_mm.dic.  Several typos in the documentation were corrected.
The Makefile was updated to use compressed dictionaries.  The new
command line option &quot;-c catck&quot; to control dictionary category checking
was added.  The default is not to check.
<P>
Release 2.1.3 added the option &quot;-p priority&quot; to the command line, and 
changed the handling to STARDICT to prevent opening of STARDICT if any
dictionaries are specified on the command line.  The default list of tags
to be ignored was updated from the DDL0 list to the DDL1.4 list.  The scan
for tags enclosed in parentheses, brackets or braces was made more robust.
<P>
Release 2.1.2 added the option &quot;#SHORT&quot; to STARDICT and &quot;-s short&quot; to the
command line to allow for a short output of unreferenced names only.
A bug which prevented recognition of names of the form &quot;*_name&quot; was corrected.
Duplicate dictionary file names are now detected and removed.
<P>
Release 2.1.1 made the necessary changes to adapt to the reorganization
of 'ciftbx.cmn' and 'ciftbx.sys' in ciftbx 2.5.1. 
<P>
Release 2.1.0 reorganized the report, so that &quot;[n]&quot; is used to identify
the fact that a tag came from dictionary &quot;n&quot; in a consolidated report
for all dictionaries sorted alphabetically by name, first giving
the data names which were not referenced, then the data names
which were referenced, and, optionally (depending on the
command-line argument -v[y|n]), a section reporting the data names
defined in the dictionary, but not referenced.
<P>
Release 2.0.4 used ciftbx 2.4.6 to report upper/lower case versions
of data item names.
<P>
Release 2.0.3 introduced support for aliases. The output is annotated
with the remarks &quot;Referenced Alias: ...&quot; or &quot;Unreferenced Alias: ...&quot;
listing the name of any referenced or unreferenced aliases to the
name being cited.  An unreferenced alias is not given a further listing,
but a referenced alias will be listed with its own citations.
<P>
Release 2.0.2 fixed a problem with identification of data names within
quoted strings.  In this release, the first blank after the initial
underscore terminates the search for the end of the token.
<P>
Release 2.0.1 differed from release 2.0 in having the format of the REPORT
output cleaned up for better column alignment and some missing parameters
on some of the cerr calls corrected.
<P>
<H3>
SIMPLIFIED OPERATION
</H3>
See PROGRAM OPERATION, above, for the full cyclops command line.
However, for routine use, an approach very similar to that followed
with CYCLOPS may still be followed.  This simple script 
file 'cyclops.sh' might be useful to execute CYCLOPS on Unix machines.
<P>
     *** ===&gt;&gt;&gt;Note the change in line 12 from the same example in earlier
versions of 'cyclops.sh' &lt;&lt;&lt;=== ***
<PRE>
     #! /bin/sh
     DICT=/usr1/syd/cif
     EXT=cif_core.dic
     if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
       EXT=$2
     fi
     DICT=$DICT/$EXT
     rm STARCHEK
     rm STARDICT
     echo &quot;#DICT&quot; > STARDICT
     echo $DICT >> STARDICT
     cyclops $1 STARCHEK
     rm STARDICT
     vi STARCHEK
</PRE>

As a first test, after compiling and linking cyclops.f to create
cyclops, use the above script to check 'cif_core.dic' itself.
<P>
        Enter:
<PRE>
     cyclops.sh cif_core.dic
</PRE>
        Note that the two &quot;extra&quot; data names detected in the dictionary
        arose from an appendix and an example. Use the listed line
        numbers to check this in the dictionary file.
<P>


        If you have a CIF that you wish to validate against the IUCr core
        dictionary, enter:
<PRE>
     cyclops.sh <filename>
</PRE>
        If you have a CIF that you wish to validate against another
        dictionary (say, cifdic.P92), enter:
<PRE>
     cyclops.sh <filename> cifdic.P92
</PRE>
